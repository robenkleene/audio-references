# Max for Live Live Design

- For visual content, like graphs, use a black background (graphical controls [e.g., like dials] never go on the black background, but number controls, toggles, and pull-down menus do)
- If the black background doesn't contain any graphical controls, then use the background color also as the tab color
- 5 pixels separate colored sections (including from the border)
