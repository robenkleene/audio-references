# Max for Live Live Design

- For visual content, like graphs, use a black background (graphical controls [e.g., like dials] never go on the black background, but number controls, toggles, and pull-down menus do)
- If the black background doesn't contain any graphical controls, then use the background color also as the tab color
- 5 pixels separate colored sections (including from the border)
- The black background section for visual content typically extends to the bottom of the device (with the standard 5px margin)
- Groups of related controls (e.g., a few dials that belong together) have their own background panel, and 5px gaps separate these groupings from each other and from adjacent sections
- Tabs use a black background, and the selected tab visually connects to the black content area below it (i.e., the tab bar and the visual area appear as one continuous black region)
