# Max Patcher

- `View > Initial Window Location`
- `View > Define Fixed Initial Window Location`: Set the current window size and position to the default position when the patcher is opened. (Find a good initial position by grabbing the lower right corner and resizing the window to the smallest size where neither of the scroll bars [horizontal or vertical]) appear any more.
