# Ableton Push Loop Selector

- To play an entire loop, press the first and the last loop pads simultaneously
- Double tap on a pad to focus on that area of the loop
- Tap the `Double Loop` button to increase the length of a loop
- There's no way to merge clips to create longer loops or cut and paste MIDI notes from Push

## Getting to the Loop Selector

- On the `Step Sequencer` tap layout to cycle through several modes, include the `Loop Selector` to the right of the drum pads
- On the `Melodic Step Sequencer` hold `Shift` and tap `Layout`
