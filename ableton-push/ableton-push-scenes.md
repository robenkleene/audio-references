# Ableton Push Scenes

## Copying a Scene Below Another Scene

By default, the `Duplicate` button makes a copy below the duplicated scene, to duplicate below another scene:

1. Play the scene to be duplicated
2. Select the scene to duplicate below by holding `Select` and pushing one of the scene play buttons to the right of the note pads. The display will say that a scene has been selected.
3. Push `Duplicate` and the scene will be duplicated below the selected scene
