# Ableton Push Automation

- To record automation, toggle on the `Automate` button and press record
- To delete the automation for a specific parameter, hold `Delete` and move the encoder for that parameter
- To delete all automation, hold `Delete` and push the `Automate` button
- Override the automation by moving the encoder, to regain it again hold the `Shift` button and press `Automate`
- You can automate a single note in a sequence by holding down the pad for a note, and pressing `Automation` button at the bottom of the display

## Troubleshooting

- By default session automation is only turned on for armed tracks, which means MIDI clips will record automation by default, but Audio tracks will not.
- To fix this, set `Preferences > Record > Record Session Automation in: All Tracks` (as opposed to `Armed Tracks`)
