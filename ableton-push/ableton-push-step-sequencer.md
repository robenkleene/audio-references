# Ableton Push Step Sequencer

![Step Sequencer Layout](assets/ableton-push-step-sequencer-layout.png)

- Top two rows are step sequencer
- Bottom left is pads
- Bottom right is velocity (to change velocity, hold a pad in the step sequencer and choose a velocity pad)
- `Shift+note pad`: Silently switch to a pad (i.e., don't playback it's sound)

## Adjusting Notes

Hold a pad to focus on a step in the clip view, you can then move the note or change its duration or velocity. Hold multiple notes to change all of them at once.
