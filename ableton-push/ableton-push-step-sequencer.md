# Ableton Push Step Sequencer

![Step Sequencer Layout](assets/ableton-push-step-sequencer-layout.png)

- Top two rows are step sequencer
- Bottom left is pads
- Bottom right is velocity (to change velocity, hold a pad in the step sequencer and choose a velocity pad)
- `Shift+note pad`: Silently switch to a pad (i.e., don't playback it's sound)
- `Layout`: Cycle between Loop Selector (lower right), 16 velocities (lower right), and 64 pads
- The `Accent` button creates notes with full velocity

## Sounds

- Hold `Delete` and tap a pad to delete that sound

## Color

To change the color of a pad: Hold the shift button, press the pad, then press the pad you would like to change to color to.

## Repeat

Hold the repeat button while holding a pad to make the note repeat. The buttons to the right of the pads determine the interval. You can change the interval while holding a pad to create variations.

- `Repeat` can also just be pushed to toggle it on, it can also be combined with different velocities with the velocity layout

## Adjusting Notes

Hold a pad to focus on a step in the clip view, you can then move the note or change its duration or velocity. Hold multiple notes to change all of them at once.

## Velocity

Each pad plays the note at a different velocity.

You can hold a step (or multiple steps) in the step sequencer and tap a velocity to set that step's velocity.

## Loop Selector

- The illuminated pads and colored pad shoe the loop length and current position
- To play an entire loop, press the first and the last loop pads simultaneously
- You can copy and paste loops in the loop selector section
- Tap the double loop button to increase the length of a loop
- Double tap on a pad to focus on that area of the loop
- Press the first and last pad of the loop simultaneously to go back to playing the entire loop
