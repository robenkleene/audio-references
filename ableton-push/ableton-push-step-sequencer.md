# Ableton Push Step Sequencer

![Step Sequencer Layout](assets/ableton-push-step-sequencer-layout.png)

- Top two rows are step sequencer
- Bottom left is pads
- Bottom right is velocity (to change velocity, hold a pad in the step sequencer and choose a velocity pad)
- `Shift+note pad`: Silently switch to a pad (i.e., don't playback it's sound)
- `Layout`: Cycle between Loop Selector (lower right), 16 velocities (lower right), and 64 pads

## Loop Selector

- To play an entire loop, press the first and the last loop pads simultaneously
- You can copy and paste loops in the loop selector section

## Adjusting Notes

Hold a pad to focus on a step in the clip view, you can then move the note or change its duration or velocity. Hold multiple notes to change all of them at once.
