# Ableton Push Midi

- Having a MIDI controller plugged in automatically arms the current track, which means empty clip slots will become record clip buttons rather than stop buttons. To stop a clip when a MIDI controller is plugged in, use the Stop Clip button (to the left with the mute and solo buttons)
