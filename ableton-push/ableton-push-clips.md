# Ableton Push Clips

## Copy, Delete, Duplicate

- `Duplicate`: Duplicate all currently playing clips
- `New`: Create a new clip
- Hold `Delete` and press a clip button to delete it

## Clip View

- `Zoom`: Zoom in / out
- `Loop Length`: Change the length of the clip
- Hold `Delete` and push a pad to delete all notes for that pad
- Push the `Edit` displayed button to enter `Note Edit` mode

### Note Edit

- Use the jog wheel to select individual notes
- With a note selected, use the `Position` encoder to change its position
- Hold multiple notes in the step sequencer, and then adjust the decoders (e.g., for `Velocity`) to change those notes.

## Troubleshooting

- If an audio clip isn't looping, in the `Clip View` just press the button above `Loop`
