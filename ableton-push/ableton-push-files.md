# Ableton Push Files

## User Library

To add files to the Push standalone user library:

1. Launch Push in standalone mode
2. In Live's sidebar select `Places > Push`
3. Drag files from the `User Library` to the `Push` section to install them

### Installing User Max for Live Devices

Ableton Push in standalone mode doesn't have folders for Max for Live devices by default (like there are in the Live `User Library`).

To create folders for these devices at the same path on Push, use the following paths:

- `User Library > Presets > Audio Effects > Max Audio Effects`
- `User Library > Presets > Instruments > Max Instruments`
- `User Library > Presets > MIDI Effects > Max MIDI Effects`

## Using User Max for Live Devices

After user Max for Live devices have been installed, they can be added by choosing the device under `Device > User Library`.
