# Ableton Push Drums

- To change the volume of an individual drum pad, that's usually done in the drum pad's specific settings. Check the settings for the individual note in the `Drum Rack` by pushing the top display buttons for each device on that note, usually there's a volume for the individual instrument in one of those devices.
- The eight encoders usually show `Drum Rack` macros, to view the settings for a specific pad, push that pad (the most recently played pad becomes selected in the `Drum Rack`).

## Kick Drums

- To demo kick drums, choose `Add > DEvice > Drums`, then set the filter to `Drums > Kick`
