# Ableton Push Drums

- To change the volume of an individual drum pad, that's usually done in the drum pads specific settings. By default, the eight encoders are usually showing macros for the `Drum Rack`, to view the settings for a specific pad, push that pad (the most recently played pad becomes selected in the `Drum Rack`). Then check the settings for the individual note in the `Drum Rack` by pushing the top display buttons for each device on that note, usually there's a volume for the individual instrument in one of those devices.
