Ableton Push Recording

- To manually arm a track: Press and hold a track button, or push and hold the record button, and press a track button
- `Fixed Length` (button on the middle left of the pads): Set the length (i.e., number of bars) to record
- After recording, to adjust the length of a clip, click the `Clip` button (in the upper right, looks like a play button in a square), then use the `Loop Length` encoder to adjust the length
