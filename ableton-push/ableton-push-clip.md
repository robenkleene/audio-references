# Ableton Push Clip

- `Loop Length`: Change the length of the clip
- `Double Loop`: Extend clip to more bars copying notes
- Hold `Delete` and push a pad to delete all notes for that pad
- Push the `Edit` displayed button to enter `Note Edit` mode

## Note Edit

- To exit note edit, push the `Done` button in the upper right
- Use the jog wheel to select individual notes
- With a note selected, use the `Position` encoder to change its position
- Hold multiple notes in the step sequencer, and then adjust the decoders (e.g., for `Velocity`) to change those notes.
- Multiple notes can be edited by holding those notes in any sequencer `Layout` (only a subset of options is available when editing notes this way)

## Troubleshooting

- If an audio clip isn't looping, push the button above `Loop`
