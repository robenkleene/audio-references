# Ableton Push Notes

- FCG: Notes above and below C ("Fast Cars Go")

- Push defaults to an "in key" mode where the highlighted pads are the scale root, and the other pads are the other notes in that scale.
- Use the `Scale` button to access different scales and keys. The encoders change the scale, and the buttons above and below the display change the key.
- Toggle off the "in key" mode with the button left button below the display after pressing `Scale`
- The far right encoder switches between `4ths`, `3rds`, and `Sequence`. `4ths` mean play three notes than the note above to continue the scale. `3rds` is the same but two notes. `Sequence` is eight pads across.
- The far right encoder determines the direction of the pads. It defaults to `Vertical`, but can be changed to `Horizontal`.

## Layout

- The layout used is called isomorphic layout
- This layout means you only have to use one pattern for each type of chord, then you can apply that to other notes
- One semitone going to the right, and five semitones (perfect fourth) going up

## Chromatic Mode

In chromatic mode, the keys start repeating after one hand length. For example the sixth note in a row is the same as the first note in the row above it.
