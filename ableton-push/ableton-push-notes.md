# Ableton Push Notes

- Push defaults to an "in key" mode where the highlighted pads are the scale root, and the other pads are the other notes in that scale.
- Use the `Scale` button to access different scales and keys. The encoders change the scale, and the buttons above and below the display change the key.
- Toggle off the "in key" mode with the button left button below the display after pressing `Scale`
