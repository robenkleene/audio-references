# Ableton Push Notes

- Push defaults to an "in key" mode where the highlighted pads are the scale root, and the other pads are the other notes in that scale.
<<<<<<< master
- Use the `Scale` button to access different scales and keys. The encoders change the scale, and the buttons above and below the display change the key.
- Toggle off the "in key" mode with the button left button below the display after pressing `Scale`

## Layout

- The layout used is called isomorphic layout
- This layout means you only have to use one pattern for each type of chord, then you can apply that to other notes
- One semitone going to the right, and five semitones (perfect fourth) going up
