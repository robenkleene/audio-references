# Ableton Push Notes

- Push defaults to an "in key" mode where the highlighted pads are the scale root, and the other pads are the other notes in that scale.

## Layout

- The layout used is called isomorphic layout
- This layout means you only have to use one pattern for each type of chord, then you can apply that to other notes
- One semitone going to the right, and five semitones (perfect fourth) going up
