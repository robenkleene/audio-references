# Ableton Push Simpler

- Samples have a mode set with the far right encoder: `Classic`, `One Shot`, `Slicing`
- In `Classic` mode the sample plays as long as the note is held, looping automatically
- To turn off warping, choose the `Warp` page from the button below the dismally and toggle off `Warp` with the wonder above that option.
- In `One-Shot Mode` the entire sample will play.

## Slicing Mode

- The first slicing mode is transient mode, which places each alive on a drum pad based on transient detection.
- The `Sensitivity` encoder can be used to adjust how easily transients are detected
- The `Beat` mode slices the sample based on time divisions
- You can adjust the timing using the encoder above the display
- You can select a pad and use the nudge encoder to select a slice start point
- You can convert the slices to a drum rack by pressing the convert button and then pressing the button  under the display
- The `Region` mode where the encoder above the display determines the number of regions
- The `Manual` mode lets you manually set slices. In this mode, press the first pad to playback the sample, press subsequent pads to place slice markers. You can then adjust slices by selecting the pad and using the `Nudge` encoder.
- In `Thru` playback mode, playing a pad plays the slice, and the  continues to play the rest of the sample.
- The `Poly` playback mode allows playing more than one slice at a time.
- The `Mono` playback mode allows playing only one slice at a time.
- `Trigger` mode plays a `1-shot` sample all the way through, `Gate` mode plays as long as the sample is pressed. The `Fade In` and `Fade Out` determine how long the slice fades in and out.

## Melodic

- If the `Warp` mode is on, playing a chord with a polyphonic sample, all notes playback at the same speed.
- To use `Glide` mode, set the number of voices to one (so only one note can be played at a time), set the glide mode to on, and set the `Glide Time`. Then when you play a pad followed by another pad, it will glide smoothly between them.
