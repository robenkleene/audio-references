# Ableton Push Simpler

- Samples have a mode set with the far right encoder: `Classic`, `One Shot`, `Slicing`
- In `Classic` mode the sample plays as long as the note is held, looping automatically
- To turn off warping, choose the `Warp` page from the button below the dismally and toggle off `Warp` with the wonder above that option.
- In `One-Shot Mode` the entire sample will play.

## Slicing Mode

- The first slicing mode is transient mode, which places each alive on a drum pad based on transient detection.
- The `Sensitivity` encoder can be used to adjust how easily transients are detected
- The `Beat` mode slices the sample based on time divisions
- You can adjust the timing using the encoder above the display
- You can convert the slices to a drum rack by pressing the convert button and then pressing the button  under the display
