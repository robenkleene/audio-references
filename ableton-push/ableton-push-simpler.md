# Ableton Push Simpler

- Samples have a mode set with the far right encoder: `Classic`, `One Shot`, `Slicing`
- In `Classic` mode the sample plays as long as the note is held, looping automatically
- To turn off warping, choose the `Warp` page from the button below the dismally and toggle off `Warp` with the wonder above that option.
- In `One-Shot Mode` the entire sample will play.
