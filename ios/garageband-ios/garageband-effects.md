# Garageband Effects

- **Phaser:** Original sound is mixed with slightly delayed signal, canceling out some frequencies
- **Flanger:** plays signal with delayed version. Both are common guitar pedals
- **Tremolo:** Tremolo raises and lowers the volume of a sound at regular intervals, creating a wobble effect

## Built-In AudioUnits

- `AUDynamicaProcessor`: Compressor
- `AUNetSend`: Send audio across network
- `AUSampleDelay`: Delay that sets time in audio samples rather than time


A sample delay is a delay that sets time in audio samples rather than time units.
