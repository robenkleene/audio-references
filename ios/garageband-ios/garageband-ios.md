# GarageBand iOS

- You have to record something in order to get the track view visible.
- Tap and hold to select multiple notes.
- It's possible to just holding the MIDI edit button and enter notes with the other hand.
- In track settings, there's a "Recording" -> "Merge Recording" option to add MIDI notes instead of overwriting, this can't record AudioUnit automation yet unfortunately).
- To convert a MIDI track to audio, tap the track's instrument and select "Merge".
- Do add audio from a track to the sampler, drag a piece of audio onto a sampler track.
- The EQ has a frequency analyzer
- Turning on Voice Control seems to break all popovers in the app?

## Overdubbing

To make multiple recordings be cumulative, e.g., to turn a knob after recording some MIDI notes, turn on "Merge Recordings":

	"Tracking Settings" > "Recording" > "Merge Recordings"

## MIDI

- To import a MIDI file, go to the loop browser, and select the file
- Once the MIDI file is in GarageBand's file browser, tap and hold to drag it onto the project to create the MIDI tracks

## Notes

- Playing effects after the visual EQ seems to cause problems?
- When merged tracks sound completely different it's because their volume needs to be adjusted?
- To select all MIDI notes, just tap the background and a “Select All” contextual item will appear.

## Presets

The Alchemy presets are oddly under the file menu in the upper left.
