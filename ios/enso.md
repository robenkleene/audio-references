# Enso

- "Length Multi" and "Length Unit" are only used when the trigger button is pressed.
- When overdub has a grey ring around it that’s because it’s going to switch from playing to overdubbing
- Hit the stop button to halt Enso recording at the next quantize interval

## Recording a Measure

1. Set "Length Multi" to 1, "Length Unit" to "Measure", "Mode Quantize" to "Measure".
2. Tap the trigger record button
3. Tap play in the transport
4. Tap the stop button in Enso
