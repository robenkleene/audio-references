# Pure Acid

## Song Mode

- To play patterns in a sequence, hold and then drag over drum pattern or sequencer pattern to play.

## Seq

- `Pattern` then `Init` to clear
- Use the arrow buttons with pattern selected to move a pattern up or down by a semitone
- **Fills**: These seem to work by automatically switching to the fill pattern until the end of the current loop, then automatically switching back to the main pattern.


## Keyboard

- `Write` to record to the sequencer
