## Documents

- You can upload the current document to iCloud by tapping the cloud icon next to its name in the "Open" menu.

## Piano Roll

- You can't quantize already recorded notes
- To copy MIDI notes: Select them and hit copy, the notes should turn yellow and start flashing, the copies can then be dragged to a new location.

## Automation

- It's easier to edit automation (instead of recording) by setting the quantization setting very coarse.
- Swipe left on an automation selection in the sidebar to delete it.
