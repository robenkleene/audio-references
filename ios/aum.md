# AUM

- Tap the channel name for the option to delete it

## Notes

- AUM seems to be able to record each audio channel separately?

## iPhone Screen Size

- There doesn't seem to be any way to scroll AU UIs that don't scale properly, limiting it's usefulness on iPhone.
- You can scroll the MIDI routing if, for example, the screen is too small to show all of them

## Sync

- Sessions can be shared over AirDrop.

## Background

AUM uses a lot of battery if left running in the background (it'll run in the background if there are any audio or MIDI channels in the session). The best way to work around this is to use `Clear Session` when you're done with the session, and click the `Last State` button to restore the last state.
