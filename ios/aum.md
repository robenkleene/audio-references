# AUM

- Sessions can be shared over AirDrop.
- There doesn't seem to be any way to scroll AU UIs that don't scale properly, limiting it's usefulness on iPhone.
- AUM seems to be able to record each audio channel separately?
- You can scroll the MIDI routing if, for example, the screen is too small to show all of them
