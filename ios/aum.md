# AUM

- Tap the channel name for the option to delete it

## Notes

- AUM seems to be able to record each audio channel separately?

## iPhone Screen Size

- There doesn't seem to be any way to scroll AU UIs that don't scale properly, limiting it's usefulness on iPhone.
- You can scroll the MIDI routing if, for example, the screen is too small to show all of them

## Sync

- Sessions can be shared over AirDrop.
