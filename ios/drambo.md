# Drambo

## Samples

### Importing Drum Hits

1. Add a `Generator > Sampler`
2. Tap `Edit Zones`
3. From the hamburger menu in the upper left, choose `Create zones from folder`
4. To import a folder from files into Drambo, select the icon on the bottom that looks like a double upside-down action arrow

### Sample Management

- There's no way to move sample folders once added, the only solution is to re-import
