# Ableton Live Tasks Sidechain Compression

Sidechain compression reduces the amplitude of one signal based on another signal as input.

1. Add a `Glue Compressor` to the track that will have it's amplitude reduced
2. Click open the `Sidechain Toggle` on the `Glue Compressor` (to the right of the on button for the device)
3. In the sidechain settings, toggle on the `Sidechain` button, and choose the signal to use as input in the `Audio From` dropdown menu
4. Adjust the threshold on the compressor until it kicks in

## Filtering

You can filter the input signal by toggling on the `EQ` button to the left of the `Sidechain` button, use this if you want to filter the input signal before using it to reduce the amplitude. You can hear the filter result by clicking the headphone icon.
