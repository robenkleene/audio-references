# Ableton Live Tasks Instrument Rack Variations

1. Multiple device chains by dragging devices to the far left drop area
2. Choose the `Chain` tab in the `Instrument Rack` interface
3. For each device chain, move the little blue zone selectors so they don't overlap
4. Set a `Macro` to the `Chain Selector` (the little tab at the top of the chain view), moving this `Macro` dial will then change which chain is active
5. Use MIDI automation to change the Chain Selector based on clips
