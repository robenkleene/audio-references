# Ableton Live Mastering 2

1. Put a `Limiter` on the `Master` track, set `Lookahead: 6ms` and `Ceiling: -1db`
2. Turn up the gain on the `Limiter` until you hear audible distortion, than turn down the gain by `1db` less than that

## Mid/Side

1. Before the limiter, add a `Utility`, `Utility`, then `EQ Eight`
2. Set the two utilities to `Mono` and right click the `Width` knob for the second one and set it to `Mid/Side`
