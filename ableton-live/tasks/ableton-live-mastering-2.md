# Ableton Live Mastering 2

1. Put a `Limiter` on the `Master` track, set `Lookahead: 6ms` and `Ceiling: -1db`
2. Turn up the gain on the `Limiter` until you hear audible distortion, than turn down the gain by `1db` less than that

## Mid/Side

The first `Utility` will represent mids, and the second sides.

1. Before the limiter, add a `Utility`, `Utility`, then `EQ Eight`
2. Set the two utilities to `Mono` and right click the `Width` knob for the second one and set it to `Mid/Side`, and turn the `Mid/Side` dial all the way to the right (`100S`)
3. For the `EQ Eight`, only turn on the farthest left and right channels, set the leftmost to cutoff 4x and rightmost to cutoff. (We'll use an additional channel to turn on `3` to scan for frequencies.)

### Initial Overview

#### Mids

1. Turn on only the first `Utility` to focus on mids
2. Listen to frequencies in the mids, use the `3` in the `EQ Eight` to scan for frequencies that sound out of whack

#### Sides

1. Turn on only the second `Utility` to focus on sides
2. Listen to frequencies in the mids, use the `3` in the `EQ Eight` to scan for frequencies that sound out of whack
