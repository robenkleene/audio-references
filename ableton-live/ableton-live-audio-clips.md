# Ableton Live Audio Clips

## Extending Length

To extend the length of an audio clip (this bakes in audio effects):

1. Drag it into the arrange view
2. Either loop the clip and select it, or to add silence, select an area spanning beyond the clips start or end
3. Choose `Edit > Consolidate` (`âŒ˜J`)
4. The consolidated clip can then be dragged back to a slot on the `Session` view
