# Ableton Live Audio Clips

- Double-click to create a warp marker
- `⇧Drag` on the audio to move the audio under the warp marker
- If all the clip slots are filled, use `Create > Insert Scene` (`⌘I`) to add another scene

## Scrubbing

You can scrub audio by turning off quantization (`⌘0`) and moving the cursor above the waveform until it becomes a cursor icon.


## Extending Length

To extend the length of an audio clip (this does not bake in audio):

1. Drag it into the arrange view
2. Either loop the clip and select it, or to add silence, select an area spanning beyond the clips start or end
3. Choose `Edit > Consolidate` (`⌘J`)
4. The consolidated clip can then be dragged back to a slot on the `Session` view

## Packs

- To add a sample from a pack to a project, just right-click a clip and choose `Show in Browser`, then drag the audio clip into `Current Project` in the sidebar
