# Ableton Live Kick Drum

Operator is better than analog for a kick drum because it has a `Fixed` option.

1. Turn off modulation so you can hear the oscillators alone (click the four color boxes in the lower right, and select the four isolated boxes arranged horizontally).
2. Turn off all the oscillators except for the first.

## Setup the MIDI Track

1. Create a midi clip (click an empty clip square in a MIDI track)
2. Create four notes at C1 (hit `⌘B` to turn on editing mode and draw the notes)
3. Add a drum rack to the track

## Operator

1. `⌘`-Drag Operator to the C1 Sample Slot (Holding `⌘` creates an intermediary drum rack)
2. Disable Oscillators B, C, and D

### Setup Oscillator A

1. Turn on the `Fixed` option, and set the frequency to `50 Hz`
2. Adjust the envelope to 0ms Attack, 1s Decay, -inf Sustain, and 50 ms release
3. Turn off re-trigger and set the phase to 0%

### Setup Oscillator B

1. Right-click Oscillator B and select "Copy From Oscillator A"
2. Turn off modulation on the Oscillators (Select the global controls in the bottom right, then select the tetris shape that looks like a straight line)

### Add a Pitch Envelope

1. Turn on the pitch envelope
2. Reduce the sustain setting to `-48 st`
3. Change the `Pitch Env` amount to between `50%` and `70%`
