# Ableton Live Hot Swap

- `âŽ‹`: Finish hot-swap accepting current
- `q`: Toggle hot-swap mode
- There isn't a way to cancel the hot-swap and return to the previous state

## Samples

When in hot-swap mode, you can navigate samples with the arrow keys and hit enter to load them in the current instrument. This works for sample packs, and individual samples.
