# Ableton Live Instruments

## Instrument Racks

- `⌘G` / `⇧⌘G`: Group / ungroup selection (e.g., wrap selection in an `Instrument Rack`)

## Drum Racks

- To group to a `Drum Rack`, right-click the device and choose `Group to Drum Rack`
- There's no built in way to ungroup, if there's just a single instrument in a Drum Rack, just selecting the instrumenting cutting, then pasting over the drum rack works.
