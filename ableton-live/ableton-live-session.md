# Ableton Live Session

- `⌘I`: Insert a new `Scene` row below selected scene
- `⌘E`: Toggle stop button (if a scene doesn't have the stop button, then when that scene plays, it won't stop existing clips, this is a way to make a clip span multiple scenes)
- `←` / `→`: Select left / right track
- `↩`: Play selected scene or clip
- `0`: Disable track or clip
