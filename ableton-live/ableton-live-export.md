# Ableton Live Export

- `⇧⌘R` / `File > Export Audio/Video...`

## Whole Song

To export the whole song, loop the entire song first:

1. `⌘A`: To select whole song
2. `⌘L`: To loop selection
3. `⇧⌘R` / `File > Export Audio/Video...`

## Trimming Samples & Saving Clips

- Just freeze the track and it will be a `wav` file in the project folder, that you can copy somewhere else to save.
