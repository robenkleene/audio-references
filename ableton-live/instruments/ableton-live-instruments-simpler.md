# Simpler

- Hit the arrow in the upper-left to get a larger view of the sample.
- To group to a drum rack, right-click and select `Group to Drum Rack` (there's not keyboard shortcut to group to a drum rack).

## Slicing

- When in slice mode, the slices start at `C1`.
- With a sample loaded, decrease the sensitivity to increase the size of the slice.
- Change from transient to gate to make the samples only play as long as a key is held down.
- In the `Thru` mode, the play-head continues to play the rest of the sample.

## Pitch

- You cannot turn off pitch tracking in Simpler, the easiest way to stop it from transposing the sample is to wrap it in a Drum Rack (or use Sampler).
- Similarly, you can't change the pitch of the sample, the easiest workaround is just place a `Pitch` before the `Simpler`.

## LFO

Click the `Control` tab in the upper right to view the LFO routing (e.g., to route the LFO to volume, pitch, pan, or filter).
