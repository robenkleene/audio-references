# Sampler

- It's easier to turn off pitch tracking in Sampler, on the "Sample" tab, turn the set the "Scale" in the bottom middle from `100%` to `0`.
- The "Filter/Global" section has an amp envelope but it doesn't appear to work predictably?
- Sampler has no per sample filter or amp envelope

## Distributing One-Shot Samples

To distribute samples, one per key.

1. Drag the samples on the sample drop area, this will map all the samples over the entire keyboard
2. For each sample, `‚å•`-click the key that it should be on, this sets the `R`
3. Right-click and select `Distribute Ranges Equally`
4. Move the boxes around manually so they're on the right keys (usually one per key, start on `C3`)
