# Ableton Live Instruments Drum Rack

## Creating

- To group to a `Drum Rack`, right-click the device and choose `Group to Drum Rack` (there's no built in way to ungroup, if there's just a single instrument in a Drum Rack, just selecting the instrumenting cutting, then pasting over the drum rack works)

## Pads

- Each Drum Rack chain receives input from a single assigned MIDI note
- You can drag a pad to another pad to move it, drag over the pad sidebar minimap to move to another bank of pads (cut and pasting pads does not work)
- `‚å•-drag` onto a Drum Rack to layer a sample by adding an instrument rack with the current sample, and the dragged sample (instead of the dragged sample replacing the current sample)

## Chain List

Pan and individual volume and panning controls are available under `Show/Hide Chain List`.

### Input/Output Section

With `Chain List` visible, `Show/Hide Input/Output Section` shows the received and played notes.
