# Ableton Live Instruments Drum Rack

- Each Drum Rack chain receives input from a single assigned MIDI note
- You can drag a pad to another pad to move it, drag over the pad sidebar minimap to move to another bank of pads (cut and pasting pads does not work)
- `‚å•-drag` onto a Drum Rack to layer a sample by adding an instrument rack with the current sample, and the dragged sample (instead of the dragged sample replacing the current sample)
