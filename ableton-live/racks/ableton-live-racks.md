# Ableton Live Racks

## Creating

### Instrument Racks

- `⌘G` / `⇧⌘G`: Group / ungroup selection (e.g., wrap selection in an `Instrument Rack`)
- **From a `Drum Rack`**: Hold `⌘` and drag a second sample onto the same slot in a `Drum Rack` to automatically convert it to an `Instrument Rack` with both samples.

### Drum Racks

- To group to a `Drum Rack`, right-click the device and choose `Group to Drum Rack` (there's no built in way to ungroup, if there's just a single instrument in a Drum Rack, just selecting the instrumenting cutting, then pasting over the drum rack works)



- Each Drum Rack chain receives input from a single assigned MIDI note

## Types

- `MIDI Effect Rack`: Only MIDI effects, only on MIDI tracks
- `Audio Effect Rack`: Only audio effects, on audio or MIDI tracks
- `Instrument Racks`: Instruments, MIDI and audio effects. MIDI effects must be first, then an instrument, then audio effects.
- `Drum Racks`: Similar to Instrument Racks. Instruments, MIDI, and Audio effects, with the same signal flow rules.
