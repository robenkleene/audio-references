# Ableton Live Racks

There are four types of racks:

- `Audio Effect Rack`
- `Drum Rack`
- `Instrument Rack`
- `MIDI Effect Rack`

## Macros

Macros allow you to take map a knob to control a parameter inside the rack. Multiple parameters can be mapped to the same macro knob.

### Mapping

To map a control to a macro:

1. Click the `Map` button on the rack's title bar while the rack's `Macro Controls` are visible
2. After clicking the `Map` button, the `Macro Mappings` sidebar will appear that shows all the parameters mapped to that macro knob
3. Click a control and an outline will highlight that control
4. Click the map button on the macro knob
5. When you're done mapping parameters to macros, click the `Map` button in the rack's title bar again to exit mapping mode
