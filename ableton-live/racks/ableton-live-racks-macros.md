# Ableton Live Racks Macros

Macros allow you to take map a knob to control a parameter inside the rack. Multiple parameters can be mapped to the same macro knob.

## Mappings

- To put a control on the Macro Control panel, just right-click it and choose `Map to Macro`.
- Use `âŒ˜R` to rename macro controls
- To add a third-party instrument's parameters, click `Configure` then move a parameter, it will appear in the Ableton Live panel for that instrument, then can be right-clicked to map to a macro.

## The Map Button

1. Toggle on `Show/Hide Macro Controls`, and click the `Map` button on the rack's title bar.
2. After clicking the `Map` button, the `Macro Mappings` sidebar will appear that shows all the parameters mapped to that macro knob
3. Click a control and an outline will highlight that control
4. Click the map button on the macro knob
5. When you're done mapping parameters to macros, click the `Map` button in the rack's title bar again to exit mapping mode

### Notes

Multiple parameters can be mapped to a single macro dial, if `Map` is active in the rack's title bar, then clicking a device parameter will activate the `Map` button on the macro dial's, if that parameter is already mapped to the device parameter, then it will be an `Unmap` button to unmap that parameter from that dial. (Note that unmapping parameters never changes the name of the macro dial, like `Map` does when adding the first parameter, so macro dial names need to be renamed manually after unmapping.)

## Macro Variations

- Show by toggling the `Show/Hide Macro Variations` button
- The `New` button stores a new `Macro Variation` with the current settings
- Double-click the variation name, or single click the play button, to restore a variation
- If a parameter changes with a variation selected, then a asterisk (`*`) appears next to its name to indicate it was edited. To update an edited variation click the `Overwrite` button (looks like the top a battery with a `+` icon on it) for the variation
