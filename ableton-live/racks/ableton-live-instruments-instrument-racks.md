# Ableton Live Instruments Instrument Racks

- `⌘G` / `⇧⌘G`: Group / ungroup selection (e.g., wrap selection in an `Instrument Rack`)
- **From a `Drum Rack`**: Hold `⌘` and drag a second sample onto the same slot in a `Drum Rack` to automatically convert it to an `Instrument Rack` with both samples.
