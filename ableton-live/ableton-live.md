# Ableton Live Keyboard Shortcuts

## Recording

### Arrange View

* To prevent a track from being recorded over, I guess click the little arrow on the right of the track? This might be the "Return to Arrangement" button?

## Tips & Tricks

* Hold `⌘` and drag to a sample slot in a Drum Rack: Automatically inserts an intermediary instrument rack.

## Sample Playback

The easiest way to playback a sample unmodified is to use "Sampler" and set "Scale" to `0%`, set the release manually to a longer length than the sample.

Generally with samplers, playing `C3` will play the note at native speed.
