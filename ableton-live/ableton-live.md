# Ableton Live Keyboard Shortcuts

* `⌘B`: Turn on editing mode
* `⌘F`: Perform a search in the browser, from here the arrow keys can also be used to navigate the browser
* `fn←`: Move the playhead to beginning of track
* `F9`: Record

## Keyboard Piano

- `z`: Down octave
- `x`: Up octave

## Collections

Change focus with the arrow keys.

### Hot-Swap mode

`q`: Toggle hot-swap mode

When in hot-swap mode, you can navigate samples with the arrow keys and hit enter to load them in the current instrument. This works for sample packs, and individual samples.

## Recording

### Arrange View

* To prevent a track from being recorded over, I guess click the little arrow on the right of the track? This might be the "Return to Arrangement" button?

## Tips & Tricks

* Hold `⌘` and drag to a sample slot in a Drum Rack: Automatically inserts an intermediary instrument rack.

## Sample Playback

The easiest way to playback a sample unmodified is to use "Sampler" and set "Scale" to `0%`, set the release manually to a longer length than the sample.

Generally with samplers, playing `C3` will play the note at native speed.
