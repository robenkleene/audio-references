## Collections

Change focus with the arrow keys.

### Hot-Swap mode

`q`: Toggle hot-swap mode

When in hot-swap mode, you can navigate samples with the arrow keys and hit enter to load them in the current instrument. This works for sample packs, and individual samples.

## Recording

### Arrange View

- When an audio in the arrange view can't be heard, click "Return to Arrangement" in the upper right of the tracks
- Clicking "Return to Arrangement" will also prevent an audio track from being recorded over by clips

## Audio Effect Rack

- `⌘G`: Group selected effects into an audio effect rack.

## Drum Rack

- Pan and individual volume controls are available under "Show/Hide Chain List"
- Hold `⌘` and drag to a sample slot in a Drum Rack: Automatically inserts an intermediary instrument rack.

## Sample Playback

The easiest way to playback a sample unmodified is to use "Sampler" and set "Scale" to `0%`, set the release manually to a longer length than the sample.

Generally with samplers, playing `C3` will play the note at native speed.

## Trimming Samples & Saving Clips

- Just freeze the track and it will be a `wav` file in the project folder, that you can copy somewhere else to save.

## Clips

### Warp Markers

- Double-click to create a warp marker
- Shift drag on the audio to move the audio under the warp marker

## Scrubbing

You can scrub audio by turning off quantization (`⌘0`) and moving the cursor above the waveform until it becomes a cursor icon.

## MIDI Editing

- `⌘1` / `⌘2`: Narrow / widen grid
- To preview notes when the MIDI editor is clicked on, turn on "MIDI Editor Preview" with the headphones icon above the piano roll notes.
- To give multiple notes the same velocity, select the notes then drag their velocity to the maximum, then to the desired value.
- To select all notes in a key, click the note in the piano roll.

## Recording

- To record an audio clip of specific length: Set the quantize amount to the amount you want to record (e.g., "1 bar"). Hit record, then hit the stop button (or the same clips play button again) for that track immediately. The clip recording will stop automatically after the quantize amount finishes.
- Recording output from a MIDI track to an audio track will only be in time if "Audio From" is set to "Resampling".

## MIDI

Ableton Live can import multi-track or single-track MIDI files but it can only export single track. To export MIDI, right-click the MIDI clip and select "Export MIDI Clip..."
