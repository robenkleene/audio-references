# Ableton Live Recording

- There's two record buttons `Arrangement Record Button` (main record button) and `Session Record Button` (farther right from the `Arrangement Record Button`), use the appropriate one

## MIDI

### Overdub

- To overdub (keep existing notes when recording), toggle on `MIDI Arrangement Overdub` to the right of the play button (looks like a `+` button)

## Audio

- To record an audio clip of specific length: Set the quantize amount to the amount you want to record (e.g., `1 bar`). Hit record, then hit the stop button (or the same clips play button again) for that track immediately. The clip recording will stop automatically after the quantize amount finishes.
- Recording output from a MIDI track to an audio track will only be in time if `Audio From` is set to `Resampling`.
