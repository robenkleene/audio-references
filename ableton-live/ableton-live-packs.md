# Ableton Live Packs

By default, packs are installed to `~/Music/Ableton/Factory Packs/`

To Delete a pack, select `Packs` in the sidebar, right-click the pack and choose `Uninstall`

## Loops

1. Loops are found in `Packs > <pack-name> > Samples`
2. These loops usually create a simpler instance, which makes it difficult to play the loop warped to a certain number of bars
3. The solution is to right-click `Show in Browser` the sample, then load that sample into a separate Audio Track as a clip
4. Playing the clip will then playback the sample looped to the right number of bars

## Sounds

- To find out which `Pack` a sound is from, right-click it in the Library and choose `Show in Places`
