# Ableton Live Clips

## Follow Actions

`Follow Actions` are used to perform an action after a clip plays.

In the `Clip View`, open the `Launch` section of the clips settings, and toggle on `Follow Action`. To play the next clip in the scene when this one ends, choose `Next` for the action (or `Previous` for the previous clip).

- `Linked`: When set to linked, a multiplier can be set that determines how many times the clip plays before the Follow Action is triggered. When set to `Unlinked` a number of bars can be chosen instead.
