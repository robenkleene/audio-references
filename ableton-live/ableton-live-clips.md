# Ableton Live Clips

## Follow Actions

`Follow Actions` are used to perform an action after a clip plays.

In the `Clip View`, open the `Launch` section, and toggle on `Follow Action`. To play the next clip in the scene when this one ends, choose `Next` for the action (or `Previous` for the previous clip).
