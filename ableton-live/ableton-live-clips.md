# Ableton Live Clips

- Double-click to create a warp marker
- `⇧Drag` on the audio to move the audio under the warp marker
- If all the clip slots are filled, use `Create > Insert Scene` (`⌘I`) to add another scene

## Scrubbing

You can scrub audio by turning off quantization (`⌘0`) and moving the cursor above the waveform until it becomes a cursor icon.
