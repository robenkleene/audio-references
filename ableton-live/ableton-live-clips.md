# Ableton Live Clips

- Double-click to create a warp marker
- `⇧Drag` on the audio to move the audio under the warp marker
- If all the clip slots are filled, use `Create > Insert Scene` (`⌘I`) to add another scene

## Scrubbing

You can scrub audio by turning off quantization (`⌘0`) and moving the cursor above the waveform until it becomes a cursor icon.

## Follow Actions

`Follow Actions` are used to perform an action after a clip plays.

In the `Clip View`, open the `Launch` section, and toggle on `Follow Action`. To play the next clip in the scene when this one ends, choose `Next` for the action (or `Previous` for the previous clip).
