# Ableton Live Midi Effects Velocity

- `Out Low` / `Out Hi`: Set the minimum and maximum output velocity, any incoming note is re-mapped into this range (for example, with an `Out Low: 64` and `Out Hi: 127`, then an incoming velocity of `1` becomes `64` and an incoming note of `64` becomes `95` [`64` is halfway between `1` and `127` and `95` is halfway between `64` and `127`])
- The X-Y display shows how an incoming velocity is mapped to a new value, the X-axis is the incoming velocity and the Y-axis is the remapped value
