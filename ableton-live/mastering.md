# Mastering

## Preparation

- First bring up volume until everything is as close as possible to `0.0db`
- Make sure instruments that should be panned are panned, kick, snare, and bass should not be panned

## Mastering

- Switch an EQ to mid/sides mode to check the left, right, and middle frequencies.
- Limiter at `0.09db`, then bring up volume.
- Create a chain on the track: EQ > Glue Compressor > EQ > Limiter, use a utility before the limiter if you need to boost the volume too much.
- Try to create a sound stage, forward, back, and middle.
- Drag a 200% EQ Eight over the track and look for resonant frequencies, and pull it down
- Cut out the low frequencies of every track with an EQ eight because they can be muddy

## Steps

1. Add an "EQ Eight" to the master channel, and right-click it's title bar and toggle on "Oversampling".
2. Switch the left most channel of the "EQ Eight" to a low cut, and set it to around `30hz` to remove any unwanted low frequencies.
3. Take the third EQ channel, which should have its "Filter Mode" set to "Bell" (icon that looks like capsule), set the "Q" and "Gain" to their maximum values, then sweep through and look for any unwanted resonant frequencies.
4. Increase the "Scale" to `200%` if it's helpful
5. Find the most resonant area and reduce it slightly in the EQ, after bringing down the "Q".
6. Add a "Glue Compressor", and set the ratio low (to `2`), `1` attack, `4` release, `-5dB` threshold. Adjust the threshold, needle should be between `0` and `5`.
7. Add a second "EQ Eight", switch this EQ to mid/side mode (`M/S`). Make sure "Edit: `M`" is set for mid.
8. Set farthest left channel to highpass, and move the frequency to the highest, this removes all the mono information in the center, leaving only the sides.
