# Ableton Live Drum Layering

- Use a `Drum Rack > Instrument Rack > Simpler` approach, this allows one note to play two samples
- `âŒ¥-drag` a sample to a drum pad to layer that sample with an Instrument Rack (instead of replacing the current sample)
- If you already have another setup with samples to layer, the easiest way to move them to the `Drum Rack > Instrument Rack` setup is to cut and paste the other instruments and effects into the Instrument Rack
