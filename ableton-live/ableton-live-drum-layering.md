# Ableton Live Drum Layering

- Use a `Drum Rack > Instrument Rack > Simpler` approach, this allows one note to play the two samples
- `⌘`-drag a sample to a drum pad to *add* a sample to that pad sample by inserting an `Instrument Rack` (instead of replacing the current sample)
- If you already have another setup with samples to layer, the easiest way to move them to the `Drum Rack > Instrument Rack` setup is to cut and paste the other instruments and effects into the Instrument Rack

## Existing Sound

To move an existing drum sound into a rack setup to start layering:

1. Right-click the existing instrument and choose `Group to Drum Rack`
2. `⌘`-drag the sample to add as a layer onto the same drum pad

### Filtering

- `Simpler` has a built-in filter on the bottom left
