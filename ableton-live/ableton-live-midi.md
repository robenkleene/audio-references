# Ableton Live MIDI

## Presets

The `Pgm` and `Bank` settings to change external instrument presets are at the bottom of a MIDI clip's expanded options.

## Routing

To route MIDI from one track to another, just create a MIDI track (`⇧⌘T`) and set `MIDI To` to the other track (you may also have to select the specific instrument to route to in from the second drop down).
