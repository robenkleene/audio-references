# Ableton Live MIDI

## Presets

The `Pgm` and `Bank` settings to change external instrument presets are at the bottom of a MIDI clip's expanded options.

## Routing

To route MIDI from one track to another, just create a MIDI track (`⇧⌘T`) and set `MIDI To` to the other track (you may also have to select the specific instrument to route to in from the second drop down).

## MIDI Effects

Ableton Live seems not to support third-party MIDI effects, e.g., when inserting a plugin, Reaktor lists `Reaktor 6` and `Reaktor 6 FX`, for the instrument and audio effects, but not `Reaktor 6 MIDIFX`, for the MIDI effect.

### Recording

To record the MIDI output from a MIDI effect:

1. Setup a new MIDI track (`⌘⇧T`)
2. Set the `MIDI From` to the track with the MIDI effect
3. Click the record button for an empty clip slot on the new MIDI track
