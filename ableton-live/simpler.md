# Simpler

- A simple way to stop Simpler from transposing the sample is to just wrap it in a Drum Rack.
- When in slice mode, the slices start at `C1`.
- Hit the arrow in the upper-left to get a larger view of the sample.
- To group to a drum rack, right-click and select "Group to Drum Rack".

## Slicing Samples

- With a sample loaded, decrease the sensitivity to increase the size of the slice.
- Change from transient to gate to make the samples only play as long as a key is held down.
- The playback mode can by change between "Mono" and "Poly".
- In the "Thru" mode, the play-head continues to play the rest of the sample.
