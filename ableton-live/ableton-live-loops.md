# Ableton Live Loops

1. Loops are found in `Packs > <pack-name> > Samples`
2. These loops usually create a simpler instance, which makes it difficult to play the loop warped to a certain number of bars
3. The solution is to right-click `Show in Browser` the sample, then load that sample into a separate Audio Track as a clip
4. Playing the clip will then playback the sample looped to the right number of bars
