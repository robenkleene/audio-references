# Ableton Live Delay

- Two delay lines, one for each channel, left and right
- The number represents the time delay in 16th notes, e.g., `4` means `4` 16th notes (which is one quarter note of delay)
- Sync is synced to the song temp, otherwise uses milliseconds
- When sync is on, offset offsets from the tempo
