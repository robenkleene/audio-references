# Traktor

- `⇧←` / `⇧→`: Load into right and left deck
- `q`: Deck 1 Play
- `a`: Deck 2 Play

## Backups

When a new version of Traktor is installed, the old version is copied to `/Applications/Native Instruments/Traktor Pro 3/Backup/`. These old versions can be deleted.

## Tips

- There's know way to unload a track from a deck from the keyboard by default, but you can change the deck type by clicking the letter (e.g., `A`) and changing it back, and the track will be unloaded.

## Key Bindings

To import key bindings without overwriting the existing map: "Preferences" -> "Controller Manager" -> "Add..." -> "Import TSI" -> "Import Other..."
