# Logic Pro Mixing

## Mixer

- To see the tracks in the same order as the tracks view, select "Tracks" at the top of the mixer.

## Groups

- Group tracks by selecting a group in the channel strip in the mixer (show the mixer with `x`).
- Once a group has been created, moving the fader for any channel in the group will simultaneously adjust the volume for all channels in the group.
- The group can be renamed by clicking the group part of the channel strip and selecting "Group Settings...".
