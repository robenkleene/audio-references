## Make an Instrument

To quickly make an instrument:

1. Open EXS24 and click the edit button in the upper left
2. Drag samples onto each key

Once the instrument has been setup, there are two options for saving it:

- Save using the existing sample locations: Go to "Instrument > Save" to save the `.exs` file.
- Export the samples and save the instrument files: Go to "Instrument > Export Sampler Instrument and Sample Files"

Note that after exporting, you can't move the location of the samples, they're absolute references, not relative references.

It's the same process in reverse to open the `.exs` file:

1. Open EXS24 and click the edit button
2. Go to "Instrument > Open" and select the `.exs` file
