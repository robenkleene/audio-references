# Logic Pro Score Editor

- `I`: Toggle inspector

## Tips

- There's three view modes under `View > View Mode`, `Linear View`, `Paper View`, and `Wrapped View`
- You can support separate parts, just by including more `Software Instrument` tracks. There's also a `Score Sets` feature.

## Export

The Score Editor has a Camera tool for exporting that appears to work similar to the macOS screenshot tool. It has either `PDF File` or `Clipboard` preferences under `Preferences > Score` (this option is only visible if advanced `Score`). The advantage of this tool is that it hides things like the playhead and uses a black and white palette.

## Style

- Double-click a note to see some style options
- In the sidebar, `Region > Style` sets the clef style (this doesn't always seem to change the clef, another method is to right-click the clef itself and choose `Select Clef...`)

## Time Signature

- To change the time signature, right-click to the right of the clef

## Entering Notes

- The pencil tool enters notes, whatever is selected in the `Part Box` in the sidebar
- To lock entered notes to the key, toggle on `Edit > Diatonic Insert`

## Quick Start

1. Right-click the piano roll and choose `Create MIDI Region`
2. Choose `Window > Open Score Editor`
