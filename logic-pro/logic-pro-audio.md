# Logic Pro Audio

## Crossfade

To crossfade between two audio regions, overlap the audio regions in the track then select the fade tool and drag across the two clips.

## Gain

The easiest way to change the gain for a clip is to simply select the clip in the tracks view and then change the `Gain` in the `Inspector` (sidebar one the left, `I` to toggle display).
