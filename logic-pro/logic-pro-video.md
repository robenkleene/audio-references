# Logic Pro Video

## Importing

To import a video, choose `File > Movie > Open Movie...`, you probably want to switch the project settings to match the video when Logic offers to do so.

## Hiding & Showing

You can hide and show the preview by double-clicking the video track.

## Time

- Under `File > Project Settings > Synchronization...` you can enter the exact length of the video.

### Getting

A few methods for getting the SMPTE timecode:

- Open the file in QuickTime and activating `Edit > Trim...` (`âŒ˜T`), clicking the right most trim handle will then show the timecode.
- Just move the playhead to the last frame of the video.
- Open the video in a video editor and view the timecode there.
