# Logic Pro Video

## Importing

To import a video, choose `File > Movie > Open Movie...`, you probably want to switch the project settings to match the video when Logic offers to do so.

## Hiding & Showing

You can hide and show the preview by double-clicking the video track.

## Time

- Under `File > Project Settings > Synchronization...` you can enter the exact length of the video.
- You can get the SMPTE timecode of the last frame of a video by opening it and QuickTime and then activating `Edit > Trim...` (`âŒ˜T`), and clicking the right most trim handle.
