# Ultrabeat

- Click "Full View" to see the patterns all at once
- The best way to clear all the existing patterns is to click on a turned on step and drag to turn off all the steps
- To mix and match drum kits, click the import button, and it open a kit in the file dialog. You can then demo hits by clicking them, and drag them to replace existing sounds.
- The notes at the bottom "pattern" and a key, are to assign patterns to a MIDI note

## Notes

The note range is from `C1` to `C3`, the easiest way to see this is to just open the Piano Roll editor (`e`), with an Ultrabeat track selected, the notes will be labeled.
