# Spoken

- Male voice should be high in the 85 to 200 range, use EQ to boost the that range if necessary, and lower other ranges.
- To make music and voice sound good together, use EQ to lower the music where it's clashing with the voice.

## Processes

- In the "Editor", run "Functions > Remove Silence..."

## Effects

Noise Gate > EQ > Compressor > Limiter

Use one of the voice presets for the compressor.
