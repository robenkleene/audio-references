# Logic Pro Export

- Use `Bounce` (`⌘B` or `File > Bounce > Project or Section`) to export.

## Bouncing the Whole Track

Logic defaults to first using the `Cycle` range (toggled with `C`), and then using the current selection (deselect with `⇧D`), if neither of those are active, then it bounces the entire track.
