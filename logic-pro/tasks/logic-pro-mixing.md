# Logic Pro Mixing

- **Send**: The part of a channel strip where you route audio through another channel strip, usually to an "Aux" channel via a "Bus".
- **Aux**: A channel strip that other channels can send to
- **Bus**: The wires that route between channel strips

## Mixer

- To see the tracks in the same order as the tracks view, select "Tracks" at the top of the mixer.

## Buses

Buses can also be used like Aux channel strips, e.g., they can have effects added to them. A bus can be added in the Environment under "New > Channel Strip > Bus".

The environment is only available if the "Preferences > Advanced > MIDI" checkbox is enabled.

## Sends

- Pre fader sends have the volume to the left and blue. Post fader sends have the volume to the right and blue. Post pan have the volume to the right and green.
- Clicking the send slot can change whether it's pre fader, post fader, or post pan.

## Groups

- Group tracks by selecting a group in the channel strip in the mixer (show the mixer with `x`).
- Once a group has been created, moving the fader for any channel in the group will simultaneously adjust the volume for all channels in the group.
- The group can be renamed by clicking the group part of the channel strip and selecting "Group Settings...".
