# Logic Pro Spoken

- Male voice should be high in the 85 to 200 range, use EQ to boost the that range if necessary, and lower other ranges.
- To make music and voice sound good together, use EQ to lower the music where it's clashing with the voice.

## Tips

- In the "Editor", run "Functions > Remove Silence..."

## Effects

`Noise Gate > EQ > Compressor > Limiter`.

Use one of the voice presets for the compressor.

## Podcast

- Right-click the HUD and select `Customize Control Bar and Display...`, and add `Varispeed`. Varispeed lets you double the speed of playback for faster editing. The `-+` button in the toolbar toggles it on and off.

### Remove Silence

To remove silence (cutting the audio into many small clips), right-click the region and choose `Split > Remove Silence from Audio Region...`.

Good settings are:

- `Threshold: -22`
- `Minimum Time to accept as Silence: 0.1`
- `Pre Attack-Time: 0.05`
- `Post Release-Time: 0.03`
- `Search Zero Crossing: On`

### Process

1. Line up the tracks.
2. Add effects to each track so they sound good by listening to a loud portion.
3. Start listening from the beginning, delete parts where someone isn't speaking.
