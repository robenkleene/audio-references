# Logic Pro Plugins

- You can click the pill icon in the upper-right of a plugin window to hide Logic Pro's buttons and give yourself a little bit more space.
- To turn off "dynamic plug-in loading", go to `File > Project Settings > General...` and toggle off `Only load plug-ins needed for project playback`.
