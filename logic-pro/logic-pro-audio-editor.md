# Logic Pro Audio Editor

- Show the Audio Track Editor by hitting `E` with a waveform selected.
- When the `Pointer Tool` is selected, clicking and dragging on the top half of the waveform moves the waveform, and dragging on the bottom half creates a selection.

## Gain

The easiest way to change the gain for a clip is to simply select the clip in the tracks view and then change the `Gain` in the `Inspector` (sidebar one the left, `I` to toggle display). (Note that this doesn't use the `Audio Editor` at all.)
