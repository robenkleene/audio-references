# Randomizer

- `Event Type`: The type of MIDI event affected.
- `Input Range`: The range of input affected.
- `Amount`: How much the incoming notes are affected
- `Offset`: Offset the output (this is convenient for shifting the values into a specific range, e.g., set it to half of the amount to start from the input value and just do higher values instead of higher and lower values.)
