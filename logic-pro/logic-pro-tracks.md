# Logic Pro Tracks

## Track Stacks

You can group tracks by selecting them and right-clicking and choosing `Create Track Stack...` (`⇧⌘D`).

### Folder Stacks

Folder stacks do not change the audio routing, and they do not have MIDI regions. You cannot add plugins to folder stacks.

### Summing Stacks

MIDI on summing stacks is routed to all tracks. You can add plugins to folder stacks.

- If the tracks being summed are already routing to a bus, then the effects on that bus will be moved to the summing track (and the bus will be removed).
