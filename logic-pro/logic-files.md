# Logic Files

The "Save As..." dialog has two options: "Organize my project as a:" `Package` or `Folder`.

- **Package**: Will save the project as a single bundle with a `logicx` extension.
- **Folder**: Saves the project as a folder, with a `logicx` project file inside the folder. By default it creates two other folders: "Audio Files" and "Freeze Files".
