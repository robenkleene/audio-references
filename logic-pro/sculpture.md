# Sculpture

- The synthesis engine is based on striking a string, the section in the middle determines the material of the string, the section to the left determines how the string is struck.
- Increasing the "Media Loss" is a good way to reduce how long the sound resonates.

## Material Pod

### Center

- In the "Keyscale" view, the diamonds represent the low and high scaling positions (above or below middle C). The green line is used for lower notes, the blue line is used for higher notes.
- In the "Release" view, you can only drag the diamond vertically because you cannot adjust the release behavior of "Stiffness".

### Edges

- **Resolution**: Increase the number of harmonics.
- **Media Loss**: Dampening of the environment (how quickly the string stops vibrating).
- **Tension**: Sets momentary detuning of the string.

#### Notes

- Like in the Material Pod, the outer sliders have have green sliders on the inside to control scaling below middle C, and blue sliders on the outside to control scaling above middle C.
