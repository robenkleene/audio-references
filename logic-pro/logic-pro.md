## Basic

- `e`: Toggle editor
- `⌘k`: Toggle musical typing
- `⌘⌫`: Delete track

## Looping Regions

For some reason you can only drag to loop regions when automation isn't visible (Toggle automation with `a`).

## MIDI Editing

- `⌥↓` / `⌥↑`: Move note up or down
- `⇧⌥↓` / `⇧⌥↑`: Move note up or down
- `⌥o`: Toggle playing MIDI notes when they are selected (or click the symbol that looks like a MIDI cable above the piano roll)

## Plugins

- `[` / `]`: Next and previous preset

## ReWire

- **Playback Mode**: Less CPU, use when not playing an instrument over ReWire (e.g., when you're only using audio routing).
- **Live Mode**: More CPU, use when playing an instrument over ReWire
- To receive audio over ReWire, "Mixer" -> "Options" -> "Create New Auxiliary Channel Strip" (`⌃n` with the Mixer visible), then choose your ReWire source as the input.

## Library Content

- The library content can be deleted from "About this Mac" -> "Storage" -> "Manage" -> "Music Creation"

## Frequency

The Channel EQ and MultiMeter both have a frequency analyzer.

## MIDI

- `⌥↑` / `⌥↓`: Move the selected MIDI notes up or down.

### Importing

- To import MIDI with the time signature and tempo information, use "File > Open" and select the MIDI file, this will create a new project.
- To just import the MIDI tracks, use "File > Import".
