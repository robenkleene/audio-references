### Master Channel Effects

- Add a "Single Band EQ" and with "Low Cut" selected, set the low frequency to `30Hz` to cut out any subharmonic frequencies.
- Add a "Compressor", select the "Platinum Analog Tape" preset, and adjust the "Threshold" until there's about `-3dB` to `-4dB` of gain reduction.
