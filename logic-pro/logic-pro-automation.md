# Logic Pro Automation

- `⌃⌘⌫`: Delete visible automation for track
- Double-click an automation point to delete it.
- There are various options for deleting automation under "Mix > Delete Automation".

## Recording

Just switch from `Read` to `Touch`, when `Touch` is set, any values changed will automatically be written to automation, regardless if record is enabled (so switch back to `Read` after you've finished recording).

## Move Automation

To move automation between two parameters, select the source parameter, then hold `⌘` while switching to the destination parameter, and a dialog will pop-up offering to move the automation.

## Region

To create region-based automation:

1. Create a MIDI region
2. Show Automation (`A`)
3. Switch `Track` to `Region`

## Troubleshooting

- If your region-based automation isn't catching, try just moving the position of the first node a bit forward.
