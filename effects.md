# Effects

- **Duck**: Reduce the level of one audio signal based on another audio signal.
- **Limiter**: Like a limiter, but doesn't have ratio, just limits the maximum volume.
- **Compressor**: Reduce the level of a signal every time it goes over a threshold. The compressor ratio is how much the volume that goes over the threshold is reduce. If the ratio is `1:8` then every `8db` that crosses the threshold is reduced to `1db`. Soft knee applies gain reduction less quickly than hard knee.
