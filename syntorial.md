## Theory

### Doubling

- Doubling is having the same oscillator twice
- The most common doubling value is 12 semitones, because the two pitches blend together really well, it makes a taller sound
- The other common doubling option is seven semitones, this creates a fifth
- Other common values are multiple whole octaves (e.g., 24, 36, etc...) or a fifth raised one or more octaves, e.g., `12 + 7 = 19`, `2 * 12 + 7 = 31`
