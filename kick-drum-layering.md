# Kick Drum Layering

Sample wave form separated into three parts:

1. Initial click transient, 1k hz<
2. Main body, punchy part, 120-1k hz
3. Long boomy tail, 100hz>

Two methods of separating sounds:

1. Just cut up the sample into three sections in a sample editor (at zero crossings).
2. Use a high-pass filter, a low-pass filter, and EQ on the middle to just get the parts of each sound that you want.

## Compressor

- Use ratios between 4 to 1 and 10 to 1. Lower the threshold until you start to see gain reduction.
- Keep the attack high to prevent ruining the kicks transient.
