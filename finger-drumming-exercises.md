# Finger Drumming Exercises

- Hi-hat on quarter notes
- Hi-hat on eight notes
- Hi-hat on sixteenth notes (try 65 BPM)
- Listen to a song and pick a drum, e.g., snare, and tap along with it, then do the same with another, e.g., hi-hat, then combine them
- Quarter note accents: Hi-hat does quarter note, other hand switches between kick and snare
- Eight note accents: Same as quarter note accents but double-hit the kick drum on the "and"
- Same as eighth note accents, but play backbeat on eighth notes too
- Sixteenth note accents: Like eighth note accents, but play the kick three times
