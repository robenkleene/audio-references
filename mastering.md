# Mastering

- First bring up volume until everything is as close as possible to `0.0db`
- Switch an EQ to mid/sides mode to check the left, right, and middle frequencies.
- Limiter at `0.09db`, then bring up volume.
- Create a chain on the track: EQ > Glue Compressor > EQ > Limiter, use a utility before the limiter if you need to boost the volume too much.
- Try to create a sound stage, forward, back, and middle.
- Drag a 200% EQ Eight over the track and look for resonant frequencies, and pull it down
- Cut out the low frequencies of every track with an EQ eight because they can be muddy
