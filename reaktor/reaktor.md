# Reaktor

- `⇧⌥←` / `⇧⌥→`: Traverse bread crumbs
- To make a split, right-click and add "Ensemble Structure in Other Pane"
- `⌘⇧-double-click`: Toggle structure and panel view
- To edit the interface, click the lock icon
- Hold `⌘` to add a port to a module

## MIDI Keyboard

- The keyboard is toggled on with `Options > MIDI Keyboard Activated`
- Reaktor's layout when using the computer keyboard as a MIDI keyboard is not documented, but `s` does some key, which is good to know for testing.

## Modules

- A `macro` is a generic container
- `1` Increases the keyboard octave, there's apparently no way to lower it? (it's supposed to be the key to the left of `1` which is backtick on a MacBook, but it doesn't work)

## Tips

- If the header isn't visible for an instrument, right-click that instrument and select "Instrument Properties", then in the sidebar, toggle on "View > Show Header".

## Notes

- Lazyfish is the great instrument designer

## Reaktor Blocks

- **Primes**: 23 modules
- **Base**: 24 modules and 35 preset racks
