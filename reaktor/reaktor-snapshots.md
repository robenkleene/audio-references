# Reaktor Snapshots

- Snapshots are embedded in the Ensemble file, whereas Presets are external files.
- Since Snapshots are written into the Ensemble file, the Ensemble must be in edit mode before writing presets.

## Tips

- Generally consensus seems to be to avoid presets because they're a bit of an afterthought technology that exists because Reaktor Player cannot edit ensemble files.

## Presets

### Files

Presets are stored in your "Native Instruments > User Content" folder.

It's unclear if a preset file can be stored in another location (such as next to a host project file), presets just aren't used very much so there isn't much information on them, for this reason, we'll stick with snapshots.
