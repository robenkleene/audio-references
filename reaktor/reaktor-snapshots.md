# Reaktor Snapshots

## Morph + Random

### Morphing

1. To select the first and second snapshot, click the box then when it says `Select...` choose a snapshot
2. Use the slider to move between snapshots (the selected snapshot changes, as well as the corresponding icon being selected, when the slider crosses the 50% mark)
