# Reaktor Snapshots

## Morph + Random

### Morph

1. To select the first and second snapshot, click the box then when it says `Select...` choose a snapshot
2. Use the slider to move between snapshots (the selected snapshot changes when the slider crosses the 50% mark)
3. The icons on either side of the slider determine which snapshot should be used for binary controls like toggles (these do not change when moving the slider)
4. The middle number is the `Morph Time` which smooths the transition between snapshots

### Randomize

- `Randomize`: Randomize (based on the current settings)
- `Rnd. Merge`: Randomize between the two snapshots
- `Random amount`: The amount of randomization
