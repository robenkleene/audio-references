# Ableton Move Quantize

- Hold shift and press step 16 to quantize
- The percentage amount is set in `Workflow Settings > Quantize`
- The percentage amount means how much each note is moved toward its quantized position in the grid (e.g., at `100%` it's moved to the nearest grid line, at `0%` it's not moved at all)
