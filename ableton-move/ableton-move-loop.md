# Ableton Move Loop

`Loop Mode` is entered by toggling the `Loop` button (looks like a cycle).

- Use the arrow buttons to move between clips
- To transpose an entire clip, enter loop mode then hold down the step button for the clip and use `-` / `+`
- There does not seem to be a way to delete all notes for a single pad in a single bar (you can only delete all notes for a single pad for the entire clip)
- `Double Clip` is the fifteenth step button (two clips overlapping each other)

## Re-arranging Clips

Re-ordering clips can be done by cut and pasting, but pasting *adds the notes* rather than replacing the clip.

So to replace a clip, the clip to paste to first needs to be deleted:

1. Hold `Delete` and push the clip to paste to
2. Hold `Copy` and push the clip to copy
3. Push the clip to paste to
