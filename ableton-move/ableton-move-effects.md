# Ableton Move Effects

- In `Session Mode`, the set's Main Effects can be changed
- Does not appear you can mute effects on Ableton Move

## Drums

On drums, the first effect slot behaves differently. The effect acts as a send, so the sound isn't filter through the effect, instead the amount that is sent to the separate channel is determined by the last (eighth) encoder.

- Holding `Shift` and touching encoders reveals more controls
