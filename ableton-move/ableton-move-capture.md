# Ableton Move Capture

- The capture button (upper right, looks like a camera view finder) captures up to eight bars

## Looping

- Once the bars are captured, pressing the loop button and the `Loop Length` will show in the display, the step buttons at the bottom show the currently playing bar. Push two step buttons at the same time to loop through only those bars.
- The jog wheel can be used to extend or shorten the number of bars being played.
- To use non-continuous bars, they need to be copied, to copy bars, hold the copy button, and push a step button to select bar to copy, then push another step button to copy to.
