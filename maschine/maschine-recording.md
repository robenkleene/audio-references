# Maschine Recording

- To erase, hold the `ERASE` button and a pad and each note passed over will be erased.
- To `Replace`, while playing press `ERASE+REC` at the same time while playing, both buttons will light up. Any notes played will replace existing notes for that pattern.
- To make this easier, you can press `ERASE+REC` first, while not playing, and then press `PLAY` or `RESTART`, to start recording with `Replace` engaged.
    - `Replace` *always* disengages when a loop repeats
