# Maschine Recording

- `SHIFT+9`: Clear pattern
- `SHIFT+1`: Undo
- `SHIFT+2`: Redo

## Basic

- Toggle on `REC` and then hit `PLAY` to just start recording instantly
- `SHIFT+REC`: Count-in then start recording from the beginning

## Overdub & Replace

- `ERASE+<Pad #>`: Erase pad # while it's held down
- To erase, hold the `ERASE` button and a pad and each note passed over will be erased.
- To `Replace`, while playing press `ERASE+REC` at the same time while playing, both buttons will light up. Any notes played will replace existing notes for that pattern.
- To make this easier, you can press `ERASE+REC` first, while not playing, and then press `PLAY` or `RESTART`, to start recording with `Replace` engaged.
    - `Replace` *always* disengages when a loop repeats

## Clear

- `SHIFT+9 Clear`: Also just clears the pattern
- `SHIFT+1 Undo`: Does the same, but just for the most recent recording

## Count In

- To `Count-In` and overdub, hold `SHIFT` and press `REC`.
- To `Count-In` and replace, hold `SHIFT` and press `REC+ERASE`.
