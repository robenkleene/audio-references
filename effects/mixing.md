# Mixing

- **Auxiliary Channel Strip**: Channel strip that other audio can be routed to, usually via a bus.
- **Send:** A way to send the audio to an auxiliary channel strip. Sends can be post pan, pre fader or post fader.
- **Bus:** Used to group tracks together so that they can be used as an input somewhere else.

## Pre- & Post- Fader

A send can be pre- or post-fader. Usually you want post-fader, but the pre-fader can sometimes be useful. Pre-fader means that if you lower the track's fader, the output signal of the aux channel strip doesn't change. Another use case for pre-fader is musician specific monitoring, e.g., of their instrument.
