# Mixing

- **Auxiliary Channel Strip**: Channel strip that other audio can be routed to, usually via a bus.
- **Send:** A way to send the audio to an auxiliary channel strip. Sends can be post pan, pre fader or post fader.
- **Bus:** Used to group tracks together so that they can be used as an input somewhere else.

## Pre- & Post- Fader

A send can be pre- or post-fader. Usually you want post-fader, but the pre-fader can sometimes be useful. Pre-fader means that if you lower the track's fader, the output signal of the aux channel strip doesn't change. Another use case for pre-fader is musician specific monitoring, e.g., of their instrument.

## Notes

> Sounds placed on this virtual stage can be positioned anywhere between the left or right ‘walls’ using the pan parameter. They can be positioned at the front or back, or anywhere in between with gain. And the frequency content will determine whether it sits at the top of the stage (high frequencies), the middle (midrange frequencies) or the bottom (low frequencies). Using this as a template, the concept behind approaching a mix is to ensure that each sound occupies its unique space within this stage so that it can not only be heard but so that it also fits well with everything else. To do this, we must subdivide the soundstage into three distinct areas: the front to back perspective, the horizontal perspective, and the vertical perspective.

# Music Production

- Difference between compressor and limiter: Originally compressor's weren't accurate enough, eventually technology made them possible, but the original compressor designs still have creative advantages.
- The three standard reverb presets are hall, room, and plate

## Standard Treatment Order

The standard treatment order:

	Faders -> Pan-Pots -> Processors -> Modulation -> Delay -> Reverb -> Automation

1. Since processing replaces the original sound, it comes before any effects that add to the sound: Modulation, delay, or reverb.
2. It's usually better to delay a modulated sound, than to have the delays be modulated.
3. Reverb is a natural effect, so it's normally untreated.

Another approach is "dry-wet", all the tracks are first mixed dry (faders, pan-pots, and processors), and then the wet treatments are applied (modulation, delay, and reverb).

## Terminology

- *Woofer and Tweeter*: The parts of a speaker responsible for the highs and lows.
