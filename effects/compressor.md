# Compressor

Reduces the level of a signal every time it goes over a threshold. The compressor ratio is how much the volume that goes over the threshold is reduce. If the ratio is `1:8` then every `8db` that crosses the threshold is reduced to `1db`. Soft knee applies gain reduction less quickly than hard knee.

## For Kick Drums

- Use ratios between 4 to 1 and 10 to 1. Lower the threshold until you start to see gain reduction.
- Keep the attack high to prevent ruining the kicks transient.
