# Turing Machine

- The left side is output gates for each step
- **Center Knob**: In the center, is half randomized, to the left is doubled sequence with the second play inverted, to the right is static sequence (not randomized)
- Lights along top are steps on and off
- Each light is a `0` (off) or `1` (on), "Write" and "Move" select a step and overwrite it with a `0` or `1`.
