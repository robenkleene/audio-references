# Ableton Note

- tap and drag left to delete bars
- move notes by selecting them, setting a grid size, and then using the right left top down arrows to move the note
- The `T` after a time (e.g., `1/4T`) denotes triplet time (e.g., three notes played in the time it takes to play two in normal time)
